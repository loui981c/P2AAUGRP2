            Frank Hvam Nielsen, known professionally as Frank Hvam 
            (born 12 September 1970) is a Danish stand-up-comedian. 
            Hvam was born in Viborg and grew up on a farm in Ørum Sønderlyng. 
            His legal name is Nielsen, but he uses only his middle name professionally. 
            After studying veterinary medicine for 3 and a half years, he dropped out to 
            try his luck as a comedian. He is known for his performance as the "geek" 
            Kenny Nickelman in the Danish sitcom Langt fra Las Vegas and as a writer 
            and performer in the Pythonesque comedy Casper og Mandrilaftalen. His 
            collaboration with Casper Christensen on Casper og Mandrilaftalen was 
            the beginning of a writing partnership that has yielded a number of comedy 
            productions, including a Danish version of the British Shooting Stars and 
            seven seasons of Klovn.
            In 2016, he joined the cast of the HBO series Game of Thrones in "The Winds of Winter",
            the finale of Season 6 as a Citadel maester.
